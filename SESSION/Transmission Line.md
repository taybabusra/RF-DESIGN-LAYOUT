Q: What is transmission line? why it is necessary and important in RF system.

# Transmission line:
The transfer of energy from one point to another takes place through either waveguides or transmission lines.
Transmission line is a guided medium.
1.
2.The electrical lines which are used to transmit the electrical waves along them are called transmission lines.
3. Transmission lines are assumed to consist of a pair of wires which are uniform throughout their whole length.
4. Transmission lines are a means of conveying power from one point to another.

## Comparision between transmission line and waveguides:
- Transmission line: It's always consists of at least two separate conductors between whicha a coltage can exist.\
- Waveguides: It involve only one conductor. example: a hollow rectangular or circular waveguide within which the wave propagates.

Q: The difference between transmission line and waveguide I am not clear on that part.

### Types of Transmission line:
the various types are 
- open wire line
- Cables
- Coaxial cable
- Waveguides

#### Open wire lines:
- parallel conductors open to air hence called as open wire lines.
- The conductors are separated by air as the dielectric and mounted on the posts or towers
- Example: telephone lines, electrical power transmission lines.
* Disadvantages:
   - Requirement of telephone posts and towers
   - High initial cost
   - Affecte by atmospheric conditions like wind air ice etc
   - Maintenance is difficult
   - possibility of shorting due to flying objects or birds
* Advantages:
   - less capacitance compared to underground cable.

### CABLES
- These are underground cables
- The telepone calbes consists of hundred of conductors which are individually insulated with paper
- These are twisted in pairs and combined together and placed inside a protective lead or plastic sheath.
* Disadvantage
   - Need to know?
* Advantage
   - Need to know?

### Coaxial line
- There are two conductors which are coaxially placed
- One conductor is hollow, other is placed co axially inside the first conductor
- the dielectric may be sold or gaseous
- These lines are used for high voltage levels
* Disadvantage
  - Need to know?
* Advantage
  - need to know?
### WAVEGUIDES:
- These types are used to transmit the electrical waves at micowave frequencies
- They are hollow ocnducting tubes having uniform cross section.
  Q: what's the problem if the cross section is not uniform?
- The energy is transmitted from the inner walls of the tube by phenomenon of total internal reflection.
  Q: What's the totla internal reflection?
* Disadvantage
   - Need to know ?
* Advantage
   - Need to know?

#### RESISTANCE:
- depending upon the cross sectional area of the conductors the transmision lines have resistance associated with them.
- From the mathmatical perspective <br>
     $R \propto \dfrac{L}{A}$
