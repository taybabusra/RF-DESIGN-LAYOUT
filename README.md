# RF-DESIGN-LAYOUT
In this repository everything related to RF circuit design layout consideration from theoretical approach to real life implementation



ROBIN UNDERSTANDING:
1.16 video done, stability 3 video undone
2. PA: FT check stability (VBIAS resistance) how does we get stability from the circuit. S21 higher, biasing Inductor and MOSFET er upoor.. 
biasing resistance er uppor gain depended. (confusion needs to be clear)
DC block matching(boarband problem) --BUSRA. LARGE Signal: 3rd harmonics important and 1 dB compression point joto high toto better. Current increase then 1dB compression point increase (negative to positive) Supply Voltage that's mean going from class A to class E. in details analysis on 1dB compression point.(BUSRA has problem)

2. LNA: Fmax & NFmin Fmax(need to know the equation --shama apu) stability.NOISE CIRCLE. GAIN circle. width (H) current(H) circuit unstable.VDD same 1db compression point (H) but circuit is more stable.
