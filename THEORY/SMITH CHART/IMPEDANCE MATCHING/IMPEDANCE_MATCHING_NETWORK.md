Q: whwy do we need to match impedance?
Q: what's the receiver sensitivity?
--> if the source and load are not match then signal will undrgo unnecessary losses because of mismatch and since the signals inherently weak you may not be able to detect it at all for you may not want transmitters, unwanted reflections that will go back to your source and maybe it could even destroy your source

--> Maximum power transfer is possible when your load impedance to the complex conjugate of the source impedance.
