Q: What is Intermodulation Distortion?
IMD occurs when muktiple signal with different frequencies interact in a non-linear systemor time variance in a system.Due to intermudulation distortion new frequencies are created that were not part of the original sounds.these frequencies can be sum or differences of the original frequencies leading to both consonant and sissonant harmonics this means unexpected sounds that add complexity to signal

The non-linearities can be calculated by generating a volterra series of characteristics or more approximately by a Taylor series.
IMD we don't wnat this becuase it can form the sideband of the operating signal.

# CAUSES of Intermodulation:
- A linear time invariant system cann't produce intermodulation. if the input of linear time -invariant systme is a signal of a single frequency, then the output is a signal of the same frequency.Only the amplitude and phase can differ from the input signal.
*
Intermodulation occurs when the input to a non-linear system is composed of two or more frequencies. Consider an input signal that contains three frequency components at
 
{\displaystyle ~f_{a}}, 

{\displaystyle ~f_{b}}, and 

{\displaystyle ~f_{c}};
