<h1>LNA Theory & Fundamentals — Quick Review</h1>

<h2>🔍 What is a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)?</h2>
<p>
A Low Noise Amplifier boosts very low-power signals while minimizing additional noise.  
Although amplification increases both signal and noise present at the input, the LNA's goal is
to add as little noise as possible through careful device choice, biasing, and topology selection.

<h2>📌 Key Questions</h2>

<h3>1. Are higher-node devices less prone to noise?</h3>
<p>Noise performance depends on device physics rather than process node alone. Smaller geometries do not inherently guarantee lower noise.</p>

<h3>2. Which adds more noise — BJT vs MOSFET? NMOS vs PMOS?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>BJTs generally offer lower noise for RF due to higher transconductance.</li>
  <li>NMOS typically exhibits lower noise than PMOS (higher mobility → higher gm → reduced noise contribution).</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. What happens to noise at high frequency?</h3>
<p>Noise typically increases with frequency due to device parasitics and reduced gain.</p>

<h2>🎯 Importance of LNA in Receiver Front-Ends</h2>
<p>
The LNA sits at the front of the RF chain. Because of its position, its noise dominates the total receiver noise figure.
Gain from the LNA suppresses the noise contribution of later stages, while the noise generated by the LNA itself directly appears in the signal path.

<h2>📡 Design Issue: Why is S11 only –5 dB instead of –10 dB?</h2>

<p>
Poor S11 indicates imperfect input matching. This affects system performance through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduced available gain</li>
  <li>Potential stability issues</li>
  <li>Higher reflection → lower effective SNR</li>
</ul>

<h2>📐 Rule of Thumb for Device Selection</h2>
<p>
Choose a device with optimum NF roughly half of the desired LNA NF target.
</p>

<h2>⚡ Gamma<sub>opt</sub> & Noise Matching Concepts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gamma<sub>opt</sub>:</strong> Source reflection coefficient that achieves NF<sub>min</sub>.</li>
  <li>Matching circuit losses prevent achieving the true NF<sub>min</sub>.</li>
  <li>Gamma<sub>opt</sub> is generally <em>not</em> equal to S11*, meaning noise matching ≠ gain matching.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Noise Resistance (R<sub>n</sub>)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Indicates how sensitive NF is to impedance mismatch.</li>
  <li>Normalized to 50 Ω.</li>
  <li>After matching, R<sub>n</sub> may appear lower than expected depending on Z<sub>11</sub> and device parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📉 Linearity Considerations</h2>
<p>
Linearity & nonlinearity play a critical role in preventing distortion and intermodulation products that degrade system performance.
