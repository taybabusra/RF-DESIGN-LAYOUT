QUESTION1: Can we minimize the noise to get closer to the NFmin: Answer yes from the NC circle we can achive this

With the approperiate values of Zd for the NC = 2.2 we did the matching

QUESTION2: CAN we get the maximum gain from the circuit ?
yes from the gain circle.

After matching this is the result NCmin doesn't changes as well as the NC of the circuit is not also that much change

--> why the gain is not 15.2 because I have only matched the input portion if output matching is also happed then we can say that the gain will be closer to 15.2

### OUTPUT MATCHING:




QUESTION3: CAN WE GET EXACT GAIN WITH EXACT NC FROM THE CIRCUIT.
YES WE CAN 
WE can get the zd from both the circle intersection point and matching with that point we can get the gain as well as noise figure fo the cicuit

After simulation result where only the input matching are happed
