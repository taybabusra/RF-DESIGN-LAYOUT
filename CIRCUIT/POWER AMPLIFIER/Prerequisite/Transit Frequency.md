Transit frequency fT of a transistor characterize ahwat is the maximum frequency a transistor still operates well as a amplifier itself
Q: what is current gain? we know for a transistor it worked as a constant current source in saturation region then what is the curren gain for a mosfet?
Q: in AC there will be current in the gate of a mosfet?
Q: what's the role of a biasing on a transit frequency?

Q: we know in high frequncy the miller effect is a very important part. but then why we are ignoring the Cgd

---> Input current determines the vgs on that develops on the Cgs

Q: For a common source amplifier let's say we are biasing the input vgs to keep the mosfet is in saturation region to worked as a amplifier to have a constant current. then in transit frequncy why we are talking about the current as we know the Ig= 0 for gate is capacitive no current flows.
