A passive filter is an electronic filter that uses only passive components like resistors (R), capacitors (C), and inductors (L) and does not require an external power source. These filters allow certain frequencies to pass while attenuating others, and they are classified into four basic types: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop. Because they lack an external power source or amplifiers, they cannot provide power gain and the output signal is always less than or equal to the input signal.  
This video explains the basics of passive filters and their types:

Types of passive filters
Low-pass filter: Allows low frequencies to pass while blocking higher frequencies. 
High-pass filter: Allows high frequencies to pass while blocking lower frequencies. 
Band-pass filter: Passes a specific band of frequencies and blocks those above and below it. 
Band-stop filter: Blocks a specific band of frequencies while passing others. 
Key characteristics
Components: Made exclusively from passive components: resistors, capacitors, and inductors (R, C, L). 
Power: Does not require an external power source, which means it cannot provide any power gain. 
Frequency: Can be designed for a wide range of frequencies, but inductors become very large and expensive for low-frequency applications, so RC filters are often used instead. 
Performance: Performance can be affected by "loading," as the output impedance is directly connected to the load resistance.
